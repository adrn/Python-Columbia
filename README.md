Some Notes
=========================

*   If you see ">>>", this means you should follow along with the code by
    typing and executing code directly in the Python interpreter (e.g., type
    ``python`` in your terminal and type into the new prompt). If you see a
    code block formatted like this

        # Some_File_Name.py
    
        Code here!

    this means you can either create a new Python file ("module") with the
    specified name and type the code yourself, or open the file from the
    folder you're currently in and just follow along. Either way, you should
    try running the script and hopefully with the accompanying explanation
    you will understand what is going on. 

*   To run a Python module, you just type ``python module_name.py`` in your terminal.

*   I'm going to use Python 3 notation unless otherwise noted. If you're 
    using Python 2, you may (in some cases) need to add some imports to 
    the top of your code that will look something like this:
    
        from __future__ import <stuff here>
    
    If you plan to use Python 2, let me know and I can help you with the 
    details.
