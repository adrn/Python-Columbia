# list
aList = [1, 15, "Munier"]

# Because list objects are iterable, I can loop through the values like this:
for value in aList:
    print value

# str
aString = "This is a string!"

# String objects are also iterable, so I can equivalently loop through the
#   characters in a string
for character in aString:
    print character
